    In computer science, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)" title="Tree on Wiki" target="_blank">tree</a>
    is an abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure.
    All tree elements are called <b>nodes</b>. The lines connecting elements (or nodes) are called <b>branches</b> and nodes without children are called <b>leaves</b> or <b>end-nodes</b>.
    The topmost node in a tree is called the <b>root node</b>.

    In this mission you are given an arbitrary tree and a target value, your task is to calculate how many leaves of the tree are to the target value.
    The nodes of the tree might be represented by any of these data types and/or their combinations: int, str, list, tuple, dict.<br>
    For better understanding have a look at the illustrations below.
    If encounter difficulties, try to watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/UANN2Eu6ZnM?t=1354" title="video" target="_blank">video</a> exposing the use of the incremental development approach.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments:
    <ul>
    <li>the first is an arbitrary <b>tree</b> data structure</li>
    <li>the second is a <b>target</b> value, any type of [int, str, list, tuple, dict]</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number of the leaves are equal to the given target value, integer.
