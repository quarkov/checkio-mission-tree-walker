    This summer the 4th annual <a href="https://pybay.com/" target="_blank" title="PyBay website">PyBay</a> conference dedicated to Python development was held.
    One of the speakers was <a href="https://twitter.com/raymondh" target="_blank" title="Raymond's twitter">Raymond Hettinger</a>,
    a member of the Python Software Foundation (PFS) since 2003, a member of the PFS board of directors from 2008 to 2012.
    Raymond's merits in the PFS are very significant: he worked on creating sets (data type), generator expressions,
    "collections" and "itertools" modules, as well as an ordered dict. He's also well known for his contributions
    to the Python Cookbook.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Raymond's presentation was called "The Mental Game of Python".
    You can watch the entire recording of the presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANN2Eu6ZnM" target="_blank" title="youtube video">here</a>.
    Raymond demonstrated using various strategies to simplify the development process and make the code simpler and therefore better.
    This mission is a variation of a data tree traversal task used by Raymond to demonstrate an incremental development approach.

    In computer science, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)" title="Tree on Wiki" target="_blank">tree</a>
    is an abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure.
    All tree elements are called <b>nodes</b>. The lines connecting elements (or nodes) are called <b>branches</b> and nodes without children are called <b>leaves</b> or <b>end-nodes</b>.
    The topmost node in a tree is called the <b>root node</b>. <b>Depth</b> is the distance between a node and the root.
    Additionally, every node in a tree can be seen as the root node of the <b>subtree</b> rooted at that node.

    In this mission you are given an arbitrary finite tree and a target. In case the target's type is <b>int</b> or <b>str</b> your task is to calculate how many leaves of the tree are equal to the target.
    Otherwise, if the target's type is <b>list</b> or <b>dict</b> you need to calculate the number of subtrees which are equal to the target.<br>
    <br>For a better understanding, have a look at the illustrations below (visual order matters for lists).
    If encounter difficulties, try to watch this part of the <a href="https://youtu.be/UANN2Eu6ZnM?t=1354" title="video" target="_blank">video</a> exposing the use of the incremental development approach.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments:
    <ul>
    <li>the first is an arbitrary finite <b>tree</b> data structure</li>
    <li>the second is a <b>target</b>, any type of [int, str, list, dict]</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number (integer) of the leaves or subtrees that are equal to the given target.
